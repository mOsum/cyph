Hi, I am the Co-Counder and COO of Cyph, Josh Boehm, or sometimes Baron Joshua Cyrus Boehm fully written out. There's kind of a funny story there; about a decade ago I supported a micronation called The Principality of Sealand, and was given the noble title 'Baron'; it's essentially a joke. I met my co-founder, way back in kindergarten, and wrote my first Q-Basic programs shortly after that in first grade. I was the Software Quality Assurance guy at Elon Musk's SpaceX for 3 years; Tesla Motors forked our software, so I would periodically sync up with them, and my job was handled by an entire team at Tesla.

I've always had a passion for both making and breaking things, but have been seemingly more adept at the latter. Technology has always seemed to fail around me, to the point where it's become a running joke amongst my friends and co-workers. Whenever code works for everyone else and fails for me, we'd call it a 'jboehm exception'. I'm not supersitisious and don't believe in paranormal penomenon, but I'm pretty sure I give computers cancer.

While working at SpaceX I had pitched to Ryan an idea for a secure comminucation browser extension which eventually evolved into what Cyph is today. It was originaly called 'CypherChat' and laid on top of Facebook Messenger. A full story of how we got from there to where Cyph is today will be coming soon in a blog post.

When I'm not working on Cyph, I like getting into heated debates (especially where I can play the Devil's Advocate), creating what I'll loosley define as "art", cooking keto (high fat/low carb) food, and volunteering (the two biggest causes at the moment being advocating third parties and mentoring children affected by cancer).
